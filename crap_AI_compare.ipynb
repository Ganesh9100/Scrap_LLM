            "**Service End Date**. To keep your Service active, you must purchase and redeem a Plan prior to your Service End Date. If you purchase a Plan at a retail location, your Service Card will contain a PIN that you must redeem to activate your Service. Family Plan Service Cards will contain a separate PIN for each line. Your Service End Date is the last day of your Plan cycle and is determined by the date on which you activated your Service by redeeming a Plan with the day of activation being deemed day 1 of your monthly plan cycle. If you fail to redeem a new Plan prior to your Service End Date, your Account will be deactivated on your Service End Date and, if applicable, you may lose your phone number(s). To prevent this from occurring, please keep your Service active by purchasing and redeeming a Plan before your Service End Date. If your Account is deactivated, it may be reactivated by purchasing and redeeming a new Plan. Once reactivated, you may be assigned a new phone number. Note that, if you purchase a Family Plan at a retail location, you must redeem all of the PINs on your Service Card within thirty (30) days of each other. If you do not redeem additional Family Plan PINs within thirty (30) days of redeeming the first PIN on your Family Plan, you will forfeit the unredeemed PINs’ value. All lines on a Family Plan will be due for refill on day 30 after the first line is activated with the day of activation of the first line being deemed day 1. Your day of activation is deemed effective as of 12:00 AM on the day you activate service regardless of the time you actually activate your service. This may result in a partial day of service being deemed a full day of service provided.\n",

Your additional lines (lines 2-5) will be charged a lesser, prorated amount that will cover the period (less than the full month) until the first line’s Service End Date. In the next Plan cycle, all lines will renew Service on the same date.\n",

Access to the 5G Ultra Wideband, 5G, 4G and 4G LTE networks requires a capable device and SIM card, inside that network’s coverage area. Actual availability, coverage, and speeds may vary. If your Plan comes with a fixed amount of high speed data, your data speed will be reduced to 2G speeds, as low as 128 kbps, for the remainder of your Plan cycle after you have reached your high speed data limit. Your data speed will be restored once your next Plan cycle begins unless you purchase a new Plan prior to the start of your next Plan cycle. If your data speed is reduced, the reduced speed may impact the functionality of some data applications, such as streaming audio or video or web browsing. Data transmitted over Wi-Fi does not count against your data usage. Certain Plans offer a mobile hotspot data allotment, allowing you to provide Data Services to an additional compatible device or devices. Mobile hotspot data speeds may vary.\n",

For example, apps that provide real-time information and location-based applications connect to our network and send and receive updated information so that it is available to you when you want to access it. We will deduct all Data Usage from the amount of high speed data provided by the Plan you purchased whenever your phone is engaged in a data connection, including any type of connection which you affirmatively initiate or those that run automatically in the background without your knowledge whether they are successful or not. The duration of your data connection and the associated Data Usage is not determined from the exact moment you press a button on your Phone. Data Usage may depend on the amount of data or content transmitted during a data connection and the amount of time it takes to send or receive the data or content being transmitted. If you cancel or attempt to cancel a data or content transmission in progress, or if the process is otherwise interrupted through no action on your part, you will still incur Data Usage.

In certain Plans, different data traffic may be prioritized at times and locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources. Where the network is lightly loaded, a Straight Talk customer will notice little, if any, effect from having lower priority. This will be the case in the vast majority of times and locations. Depending on your plan, at times and at locations where the network is heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, however, a Straight Talk customer will experience increased latency during a data session, particularly if the customer is engaged in a data-intensive activity. When network loading goes down or if a customer moves to a location that is less heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, the latency associated with a customer’s data connection will improve.\n",

Within coverage areas, there may be significant limitations or interruptions in coverage that may impact service and result in dropped and blocked connections, slower Mobile Web Service and data speeds or no Mobile Web Service or data connectivity and call interference. This could occur due to many factors including your device, network changes, network traffic volume, network outages, technical limitations, signal strength, the terrain and your proximity to buildings, foliage and other obstructions, weather and other conditions. You will not be able to operate your phone or make 911 calls if service is not available. Some features on your device may not operate when roaming on the network of a network roaming partner. If you travel outside of your coverage area, your phone will not work.

Bytes are rounded up to the next KB with rounding occurring during and/or at the end of the data session. All data that is directed to your device’s internet address, including data sessions that you do not initiate or complete, are counted against your data usage. Examples of data that will count as part of your data usage are: sending or receiving email, documents, pictures or other files; multimedia streaming (music and video); file uploads and downloads; gaming services, graphics and applications; web page graphics (including logos, pictures, banners, advertisements and updates to any of the aforementioned); automatic device updates and any other automatic updates; any additional data necessary in order to access, transport and route files on the network; data associated with incomplete or interrupted downloads; and data associated with unsuccessful attempts to upload or download a file, reach a website, use an application or complete an online form or purchase; and any data that is re-sent (such as when refreshing a page or browser). Data usage includes all data that is downloaded, even though you may not have listened to or watched the entire download. The data that is consumed and applied against your data usage is in addition to any charges you may incur for purchased data content (such as the cost associated with purchasing music, games, apps, movies, etc.). The amount of data consumed and calculated as your data usage will vary significantly even with respect to identical actions and data sessions. Estimates of data usage such as the size of downloaded files are not accurate indicators of actual data consumed during a session.\n",

Upon request from Straight Talk, the Purchaser must prove the date of the original purchase of the Product by a dated bill of sale or dated itemized receipt.\n",
            "\n",
            "3\\. During the limited warranty period, Straight Talk will replace or repair, at Straight Talk’s sole option, any defective Products or parts (except as excluded below) with new or refurbished Products or parts if such replacement or repair is needed because of Product malfunction or failure during normal usage. Straight Talk may, in its sole discretion, replace the Product with a different but comparable Product if the same exact Product is not available.

The limited warranty does not cover loss of personal information, passwords, contacts, music, ringtones, pictures, videos, applications or other content, memory cards, software, defects in appearance, cosmetic, decorative or structural items, including framing, and any non-operative parts. Straight Talk’s limit of liability under this limited warranty is the actual cash value of the Product at the time the Purchaser returns the Product to Straight Talk for repair, determined by the price paid by the Purchaser for the Product less a reasonable amount for usage. Straight Talk shall not be liable for any other losses or damages. These remedies are the Purchaser’s exclusive remedies for breach of warranty.\n",
