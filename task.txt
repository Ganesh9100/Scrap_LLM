Task - Scraping website info dynamically and transforming it for better RAG performance.
Compare jina.ai and crawl4ai as well.
The scrapped content is too long and cannot be passed into the model directly so it requires some kind of pre-processing and chunking.
You can for tomorrow focus only on the pre-processing that is needed - because the top few and the bottom few data will be headers and footers details. How to dynamically or automatically convert scraped data and have it ready for model consumption.
After that show chunking and chunk overlap for increased context in RAG.
